## Case Example: Design System

The PartsApp Design System is a comprehensive collection of frameworks, guidelines, and tools used to promote more efficient and consistent development and to enhance the user experience.

Product Design

# The Challenge

When I started working on PartsApp, I saw that there were a lot of inconsistent elements in the product, a large number of different colors, typography settings in the same cases were different, many inputs looked and worked differently, although they performed the same action. 

So, after discussing all the problems with the team, we came to the conclusion that we needed to build a design system, as the number of features in the product increased and these problems continued to spread more and more. 

In the examples below, I'll show you how some of the components in the design looked like on the example of several pages with similar functionality. 

# Building The Foundations

The next stage of work began with a full audit of the platform and prioritization. Having the audit findings, we started building tokens for colors, fonts, indents, and rounding angles. We also decided to use a library of icons in the same style. To do this, we bought a library from Untitled UI. 

# How Variables Are Named

Variables follow a clear, consistent, and unambiguous naming convention that is easy to use and understand.

Alias and component variables are named based on their function rather than their value, making it easier to locate the correct variable quickly. Here’s the naming convention for variables:

The variable above tells a clear story. Without needing to look it up, you can already understand its purpose. This is a color variable meant for foreground elements in components when they're in a hover state. The term "Secondary" indicates there are other variants of this variable that establish hierarchy, like primary, secondary, and tertiary.

# Semantics

As the name implies, "semantics" represents different states used to give visual feedback or warnings to users, such as error and success.

# Hierarchy

This variable's position in relation to other design elements within the visual hierarchy is important. For colors, these are typically categorized as primary, secondary, tertiary, and so forth.Creating The Components

After creating Foundations, it's time to start creating components. To do this, I conducted an audit of the platform to find components that could be used as a basis to avoid drawing everything from scratch. I also immediately wrote a priority list to the developers of what would need to be included in the code as common components. 

# Our next steps

Next, we started working on writing documentation for the system design and began implementing it in the code. We also started redesigning the old sections of our product, below you can see how page look like after the implementation of the system design.

Let me remind you that at the beginning I showed you how different pages looked before. 

# Outcome

After the implementation of the system design, the following changes took place:

- The product began to look consistent, which was also noticed by users
- The development and testing process has accelerated by 20%
- The process of creating new pages has accelerated by 30%
- The number of code lines decreased, which had a positive impact on product performance.
