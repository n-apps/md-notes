## Hi! I'm Roma.

### *about*

I’m a product designer with 5 years of experience turning complex problems into simple, useful solutions for both B2B and consumer markets (SaaS, marketplaces, e‑commerce). I love blending logic, UX, and design systems to build experiences that feel effortless and meaningful.

I also created the top-rated Android app Score Counter, which helps over 180,000 people every month.

Right now, I'm looking for my next adventure 🔭
