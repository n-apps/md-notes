## [Social media posts] Score Counter: Count Anything

## Linkedin post #1

description: 9 years in and my &quot;little&quot; side project is still growing 🚀

As 2025 wraps up, I took some time to review the performance of Score Counter. In an era where apps come and go, I’m proud that this simple utility tool is still finding its way onto thousands of devices – without a dollar spent on marketing. 

2025 retrospective by the numbers:
📈 Active devices grew to ~170,000 (up from 109k in Jan!)
⭐ 4.9 average rating (maintained)
👨‍💻 108 commits to the codebase
🏳️ 2 new languages added
🚫 Zero ads (and keeping it that way)

Technical maintenance is never done. I shipped several updates this year to keep the experience at a high level:
✅ Full support for Android 16
✅ A new Auto-sorting feature
✅ Grid View and landscape support for tablets
✅ The heavily requested Timer feature ⏱

Thank you to everyone who downloaded, rated, or contributed code this year 🥂

description: 🌟 Got an email yesterday that made my whole week!

I have this little Android scorekeeper app — nothing fancy, it just helps people track scores when playing games instead of fumbling around for a pen and paper — and it has already passed the 600K install milestone 😎

I recently received a surprising and heartwarming email from Tarek, a developer who had previously contributed a Swedish translation for my pet project, the Scorekeeper Android app. To my delight, Tarek shared that he was so inspired by the app that he created a web version of it as a personal exercise! 😊

Seeing my idea come to life through someone else's work was incredibly humbling and rewarding. Best compliment ever!

🚀 Check it out at score.takki.org

Anyone else have stories of unexpected connections through their projects?
