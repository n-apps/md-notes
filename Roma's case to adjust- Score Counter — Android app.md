# Roma's case to adjust: Score Counter — Android app

2016 – Present · Live on Play Store

### A side project that grew to 180,000+ active users — with zero marketing. Over 9 years, I’ve refined the design, improved the tech, and built a loyal global user base through steady iteration and care.

##### What I did

- Managed the full product lifecycle: from initial UX research to development and store optimization
- Shipped 100+ updates, including major 2025 features like Auto-sorting, Grid View for Tablets and the highly requested Timer feature
- Upgraded for Android 16 to keep the UI modern and aligned with Material Design
- Localized the app into 10+ languages to reach more users worldwide

##### I was proud to achieve the following results

- 180,000 active devices (up from 109,000 in early 2024)
- 700,000+ total installs across 10+ languages
- 4.9 average rating over 9 years
- #1 ranking for “score counter” on Google Play

##### Tools used

- Android Studio
- Figma
- LLM code generators
- Github
