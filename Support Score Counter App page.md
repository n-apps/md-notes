### About the Score Counter app

Hi, I’m Roma — a designer from Ukraine who loves board games. I built Score Counter in my free time as a simple, fun way to keep track of scores. It’s a small passion project made with care.

### Why players love Score Counter

Ad‑free experience: Enjoy your games without any annoying ads or pop‑ups.

Built with heart: Even through tough times 🇺🇦, I keep improving this app for everyone who loves board games as much as I do.
