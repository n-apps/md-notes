# Case Study Recommendations for Product Designers

The primary goal of a case study is to tell a **concise and impactful story** of your experience to get you invited for an interview. For a designer with 5 years of experience, the focus should shift from just showing "craft" to demonstrating **business impact and communication skills**.

## 1. The 9 Core Building Blocks

Use these blocks to structure your story. You can remix them, but they serve as the foundation of a professional case study:

1. **Title and Subtitle:** Usually the company name. The subtitle should briefly explain the context and, ideally, the result (e.g., "Increasing revenue by $6M").
2. **Final Result Preview:** Think of this as your "movie poster." Show the most defining visual (mobile/web mockup) right at the top.
3. **Role, Team, and Timeline:** Clarify if you were leading the project or contributing. Mentioning the team setup (e.g., "working with 2 PMs and 3 engineers") helps recruiters see how you collaborate.
4. **Challenge:** What were you solving and for whom? Use the **"How Might We...?" (HMW)** method to frame the problem.
5. **Status Quo:** Describe the starting point. Was it a "0 to 1" project or a redesign of an existing feature?.
6. **Process:** Show how you approached the challenge. Include artifacts like research findings, JTBD, or usability test results, but **don't over-detail**.
7. **Final Result Showcase:** Finish with a "bang." Use videos of prototypes or sequences of key screens to show how the design solved the initial challenge.
8. **Impact (Metrics & Feedback):** The answer to the "so what?" question. Highlight conversion growth, user retention, awards, or positive testimonials.
9. **Learnings (Optional):** Demonstrate self-reflection. What would you do differently next time? What did this project teach you about user behavior?.

## 2. Methodology: How to Write the Case

If you are struggling to start, use one of these three methods:

- **Method 1: Memory Storytelling.** Write down everything you remember about the project without filtering. Use speech-to-text if it's easier. Then, use the 9 blocks above to extract the most important parts.
- **Method 2: Work Journal.** For current projects, document decisions as they happen. Record motivation, measure success criteria, and save "nice things people say" to use as future testimonials.
- **Method 3: Project Grouping.** If you have multiple small features at one company, combine them into one "umbrella" case study with several mini-chapters.

## 3. Essential Tips for Senior Designers

- **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front):** Present the solution, challenge, and impact **immediately**. Only then go into the process for those who want to dive deeper.
- **Show "Just Enough" Process:** Hiring managers spend about **30–60 seconds** per case study. Avoid showing 600 unreadable Miro stickies; show only the artifacts that were crucial to the decision-making.
- **Quality over Quantity:** Having **three really good case studies** is better than six medium-quality ones.
- **Order by RRR-ness:** Do not order by recency. Put your most **Relevant, Remarkable, and Recent** work at the very top.
- **Optimize for Scanability:** Only 16% of people read every word. Use clear headlines and let the visuals do the talking.
- **NDA Management:** If the work is confidential, use passwords, blur sensitive data, or "white label" the project by removing branding.

### Action Points for Roma:

1. **Select 2-3 bangers** (Yesim and Score Counter are excellent candidates based on your RRR-ness).
2. **Fill out the Case Study Canvas** for each project to ensure you have all 9 blocks.
3. **Start with a presentation** or a Figma prototype before building a full website to "fix time and flex scope".
